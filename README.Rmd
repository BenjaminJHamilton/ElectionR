ElectionR aims to provide convenient methods for analysing election results. This package
is built as a way to gain experience in producing packages in R.

## Installation

You can install the development version of ElectionR from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("BenjaminJHamilton/ElectionR")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(ElectionR)

df <- data.frame(party = c("A Group", "B Team", "C Fellas"), votes = c(5.5, 9.2, 1.2))

vote_share(df)
```
